// leland_dac_mixer -- DAC/mixer datapath.
//
// Takes the sound board's digital DAC register outputs (six 8-bit sample+volume pairs
// and one 10-bit sample) and produces one mono signed 16-bit PCM stream; the top level
// duplicates it to both channels (leland_a.cpp has a single front_center speaker).
//
// Each 8-bit channel is an AD7524 multiplying DAC whose reference is driven by a second
// DAC (the volume register), so the output is proportional to sample * volume. `sample`
// is offset-binary (128 is zero) and `volume` is a plain 0-255 gain. dac9 (AD7533) has
// no volume register, is offset-binary centred at 512, and has gain 1.0.
//
// Gains: leland_a.cpp routes each 8-bit channel at 0.2 and dac9 at 1.0, implemented as
// Q8 multipliers (GAIN_8BIT=51/256, GAIN_10BIT=255/256). dac9's signed range (-512..511)
// is first scaled by DAC9_SCALE to match one 8-bit channel's full-scale product
// (~32640), so both channel types land in a comparable range before summing.
